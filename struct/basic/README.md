# basic struct

Simple example of a struct, a struct allows us to create our own data types that hold related information. 

In this case the struct `Person` holds an age and name for a person.

First we create an instance of a struct `struct Person person` which is the equivalent of `int i`.

To access the age or name propery on the struct we use `.` notation. In this case to set the age we use 'person.age = 10'.

When we print out the values in the struct we use the same `.` notation to get the values.
