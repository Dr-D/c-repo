# string replace char

An example of how to replace a char in a string.

In main we create the src and destination strings and decide on the char we want to replace and character we want to replace it with. 

str_replace uses a while loop similar to our strcopy function. There is a simple check if the character is the one we want to replace then replace it otherwise just copy the original character from source.
