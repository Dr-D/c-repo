# string reverse

An example of how to reverse a string.

The strreverse parameters are copies of the pointers for the dest & src strings.
We make a copy of the pointer to the start of the source string

Testing Reverse0
^

We then move the pointer to the last character of source
Testing Reverse0
              ^

The less than and greater than can be used for pointers but must be pointing to the same object.
So we then copy the characters until we get to the start of the source string.
