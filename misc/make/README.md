#make1-10 directories

These are a group of makefiles that should be followed in numeriala order.
Starting with a simple make file and show how to make a simple but versatile makefile that can work for small and medium size applications.

There is still plenty to learn after you have finsihed them but they should hopefully give a starting point in easy to follow steps.

I will hopefully add specific files to the 'make' directory when I find interesting or difficult to learn topics.
