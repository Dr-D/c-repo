# create library

There is a bash script createArchive.sh that will run all the commands to create the libmymath.a library.

This is obvously a basic example to show how to create and use a library. Normally all the methods that are in the separate *.c files would all be in one file with lots of other methods.

The script itself has comments that are printed out when it is run so is fairly self explanatory.
