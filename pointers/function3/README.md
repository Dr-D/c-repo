# Passing array of pointers to functions as parameter

Example of array of pointers to a functions being passed as a parameter to a function.

The function add_int and multiply_int  are function that take two integers.

They are added to an array of pointers to functions - *arr_pfunc[2].

The array is passed into operator function along with three integers.

arr_func[0] is the pointer to add_func = 90 + 10.

arr_func[1] is the pointer to multiply_func = 100 * 5.

Coming back to this with a bit more experience trying to have a play with function pointers.

Difficulty trying to dereference a pointer to an array of function pointers.
