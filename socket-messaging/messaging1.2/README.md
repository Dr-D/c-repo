# Messaging1.2

# Main - Client

The client is essentially the same code as found in Messaging1 it has been moved to its own multicast client file mclient.c.

The client now sends the host ip address and unique id for the multicast message.

# Logging
Added simple logging to stdout, may look at this later to try to log to file.
